        <p>Peanut Butter Cookies, who could resist them? I've loved peanut butter cookies as long as I can remember and they'll always be one of my favorites.
        So of course it only makes sense that I share my idea of the best peanut butter cookie recipe. This is my go-to recipe and best of all - it's only three ingredients! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup of your favorite peanut butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350ยบ</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix together the peanut butter, sugar, and egg.</li>
                <li>Scoop out a spoonful of dough and roll it into a ball. Place the cookie balls onto a nonstick baking sheet.</li>
                <li>For extra decoration and to make them cook more evenly, flatten the cookie balls by pressing a fork down on top of them, then press it down again at a 90ยบ angle to make a criss-cross pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies are golden brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from baking sheet and cool.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>

            </ol>
